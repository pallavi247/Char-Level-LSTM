# Char-Level-LSTM
Character-level LSTM with PyTorch. This is a mini project/exercise in my Deep Learning Nanodegree Program from Udacity.

This model will be able to generate new text based on the text from the book by Anna Karenina.

Please find the dataset in folder /data.

## Instructions
Load in text data
Pre-process that data, encoding characters as integers and creating one-hot input vectors
Define an RNN that predicts the next character when given an input sequence
Train the RNN and use it to generate new text
